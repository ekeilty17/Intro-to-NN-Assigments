# Introduction to Neural Networks

In the summer of 2020 while everyone was social distancing, a number of people asked me to teach them the basics of neural networks and deep learning. This repository contains of the powerpoint slides and coding assignments I created in order to teach these concepts.

The target demographic are people who are familiar with coding, but don't necessarily need to be experts, and generally have a good grasp of mathematics up to and including calculus. For example, the people I taught were generally electrical engineers, financial engineers, and first year computer science students.
